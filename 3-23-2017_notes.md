I think we had a productive discussion between the IX group and the Visual Design group today. It seemed like we started to differentiate
our groups' goals a bit and we learned a lot by sharing our work. With that in mind, I thought it might be helpful to add some notes. These
are from my perspective, so feel free to add anything of your own or correct something that I say.

**Visual Design Takeways**  
It sounds like we have the right workflow already based on the workflow that NC drew up for us. 
People received the recommended blocks section well. It sounded like Erica viewed that section as a place where potential "alternate" blocks could
come from. So if those are going to be unplugged alternates that can get pulled into the flow graph, we will need to think about how users can 
select them and add them to the graph.

Per Erica's comments, we also need to beef up the amount of data we are showing users. Since our users are engineers, they would rather have settings
and variables displayed. Our users will trade cleanliness in the display for feeling like they can manipulate whatever they need to. In the same
vein, we need to make sure that our visual design allows our users to easily make changes on different blocks.

Also, I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, but looks like draw.io doesn't have any capability to create clickthroughs (because it can't link internally). 
I also don't see tons of capabilities that Google Slides doesn't have. If you want to get practice with a wireframing took, Axure does seem
nice enough and they gave me a free student license very quickly. Still, if we want to go that route, now is the time to decide.
